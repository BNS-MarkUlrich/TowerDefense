# TowerDefense
The concept for my Tower Defense will be an RTS/Survival mix. You will start with a basic base and 4 turrets basic single target turrets. For this basic Tower Defense, the goal will be to survive as long as you can.

Enemies will be spawning from random directions (potentially from outside of the player's FOW (Fog Of War)). The timer will count upward and enemies will get gradually harder.

Git Workflow:
* This Repository will consist of only a Main and Developer branch.
* The Developer Branch will be updated constantly with WIP progress.
* The Main Branch will be updated at the start of each new sprint.
